        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="about-me">Hi, I'm Rafan Ahamad Sheik, a 2nd year CS engineering student studying in P.A College of engineering. I am a passionate learner and always like to stick my nose into techincal stuff. I have been learning coding for the past month but I haven't been really that consistent with it. So I am trying my best to be comitted to coding everyday and learning new things and much more. Hope whoever is seeing this is has a good day.</p>
